<a name="6-1"></a><h2>After few hours of Internet search, I have found about 20 BDM pods
available. Why are you trying to augment existing chaos by another pod?</h2>

<p>In present time (2004), I haven't found any BDM interface with
freely available construction plans, ie. schematics and eventually a
firmware, other than pod of <a href="index.en.html#malte-avenhaus">Malte Avenhaus</a>,
which, however, could be
used only after much stronger effort (to write a support to debugger),
than contruction of whole podex.</p>
<a name="6-2"></a><h2>Why did you copy Kevin Ross' protocol? Don't you think it is
morally wrong?</h2>

<p>By all means it is better to use existing, although a bit dumb,
protocol, if it is sufficient, than to plague the world with another
incompatible pod, moreover, to add another support code to gdb for the
very same, only camouflaged thing -- to waste efforts to write a
debugger port, debug the debugger... By all means it is better to unify
with existing gdb port and to try to improve this port, which will help
users of both pods. This solution also means to be supported by other
debuggers, which supports Kevin Ross for a long time. I don't think, it
is immoral, I haven't stole anything of Kevin Ross, I haven't ever seen
his BDM pod, neither his debugger db12.exe. Anyway, many thanks to him
for publishing his communication protocol.
</p>
<a name="6-3"></a><h2>Why have you used AVR MCU? Why not HC08, HC11, HC(S)12? Why not
PIC,...?</h2>

<p>AVR processors are cheap and little, they have very nice and
consistent assembler, they aren't so fancy, as messy family of PIC,
they have great and effective support of GNU tools. Firmware of podex
isn't fixed to any specific AVR model, it works with AT90S2313 (well,
not very fresh meat...), so it will work in other AVR as well.</p>
<a name="6-4"></a><h2>Where can I buy podex? How much does it cost?
</h2>

<p>You cannot (at least at this moment). Podex is a construction plan
published for free use. I don't know, if I would like somebody to sell
it -- if you are interrested in production of PCB's, selling components
or final pods, let me mail, we can think about it.</p>
<a name="6-5"></a><h2>What is podex able to? Which debuggers are able to work with?
</h2>

<p>Podex can program and debug processors of Motorola 68HC12 and HCS12
family, at this moment operating at 5V voltage and crystal frequency up
to cca 20MHz, maybe also a higher. Podex is intended to be used with
debugger GNU gdb, but it should work also with NoICE and StingRay.</p>
<a name="6-6"></a><h2>What isn't podex able to?</h2>

<p>To work with processors, other than HC(S)12 family, with other
interfaces, than their BDM. Podex doesn't know JTAG, podex won't talk
with HC08, HC11, neither M68300, neither with your mother-in-law...</p>
<a name="6-7"></a><h2>Why writing to my FLASH doesn't work?</h2>

<p>Are you using gdb? If you are, then make sure, you have a correct
<a href="podex_gdb.en.html#gdb-flash">routines for erasing and writing to FLASH</a>.
Are you using some
another debugger? Mail to the vendor, your podex is OK.
</p>
<a name="6-8"></a><h2>When trying to connect with gdb to target bdm12, I get a
communication error (bdm12_put_packet RTS1-&gt;CTS1: Couldn't
communicate with
BDM12 pod)</h2>

<p>Do you have podex plugged directly into a serial port? If not, does
your serial cable have wires even for both signals RTS and CTS? Are you
trying to connect to <a href="podex_gdb.en.html#gdb-target">right port</a>?
In a hopeless case, you can try to
enlarge timeout constants in <a href="www/sw/gdb/src-2.91/bdm12.h">bdm12.h</a>,
if you think your computer/bus is running out of resources.
