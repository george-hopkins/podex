<a name="4-1"></a><h2>Podex and GNU gdb</h2>

<p>Podex is to operate with excellent GNU debugger gdb. Gdb can be used
with podex to load a code to RAM and FLASH memories of HC12, to run and
step programs in them, to use breakpoints etc. while working at level
of assembler as well as on a higher language (C) source level. I worked
in gdb in cooperation with 68HC1x branche of GNU gcc and binutils, but
GNU gdb should principially work with output of other compillers as
well. There are supported formats such as ELF, S-record, headerless
binary and others contained in bfd library, for source-level debugging
there is used format stabs (and maybe also others).
</p>
<a name="4-1-1"></a><h3>How to obtain gdb for podex?</h3>

<p>Gdb port for Kevin Ross' BDM12 protocol has been added to 68HC1x
branch of gdb by Timothy Housel. While podex was in a development stage
(April 2004), there were available 68HC1x patch for gdb-6.0 marked
20040222
(<a href="http://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/gdb/gdb-6.0.tar.gz">gdb-6.0.tar.gz</a>
[<a href="sw/gdb/gdb-6.0.tar.gz">local copy</a>],
<a href="http://m68hc11.serveftp.org/m68hc1x-builder-2.91.tar.gz">m68hc1x-builder-2.91.tar.gz</a>
[<a href="sw/gdb/m68hc1x-builder-2.91.tar.gz">local copy</a>]).
I suggest also to apply
another little patch for BDM12 support code in gdb, which corrects one
race-condition bug and also enlarges some timeout constants, what has
been found necessary, especially while working with USB-RS232 converter
or on heavy loaded machines. (Patch haven't been merged with a 68HC1x
branch yet, so it can be downloaded
<a href="sw/gdb/gdb-bdm12-mp.diff">here</a>.)</p>
<p>GNU gdb is in philosophy a unix application, but BDM12 port, what
means its code for acces to RTS, CTS lines of serial port, is written
to be compatible with unix-like GNU environment Cygwin32/Mingw32 for
the poor ugly operating chaos M$ Windows. To compile gdb, download
mentioned sources: official source GNU <tt>gdb-6.0.tar.gz</tt>, M68HC1x branch
<tt>m68hc1x-builder-2.91.tar.gz</tt> and a patch <tt>gdb-bdm12-mp.diff</tt>.
Then unpack, patch and make:</p>
<blockquote><table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3"><tr><td><pre>
tar xzvf gdb-6.0.tar.gz
tar xzvf m68hc1x-builder-2.91.tar.gz
cd gdb-6.0
patch -p1 &lt; ../m68hc1x-builder-2.91/gdb-6.0-m68hc1x-20040222.diffs
patch -p1 &lt; ../gdb-bdm12-mp.diff

./configure --target=m68hc11-elf --program-prefix=m68hc12-
make
#optionally with root privileges do a make install (by defult to /usr/local/...)
</pre></td></tr></table></blockquote>
<p>I suggest also to install a 68HC1x GNU tools gcc and binutils
(including the gas assembler). They are often available as precompiled
packages in many GNU operating system distributions (eg. Debian Linux),
what can save yourself from the bloody compilation.</p>

<a name="4-1-2"></a><h3>Basic use of gdb with podex
</h3>

<p>Operation with podex in gdb is introduced by command target bdm12:</p>
<blockquote><table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3"><tr><td><pre>
(gdb) target bdm12
Usage: target bdm12 &lt;serial_device&gt; &lt;E-clock rate (1,2,4, or 8 MHz)
                            &lt;register base&gt; &lt;ram base&gt; &lt;eeprom base&gt; &lt;flash base&gt;
(ex. target bdm12 com1 8 0x0 0x800 0xd00 0x8000 on Win32,
   or target bdm12 ttya 8 0x0 0x800 0xd00 0x8000 on UNIX)
</pre></td></tr></table></blockquote>
<a name="gdb-target"></a>
<p>Where serial_device is a name of the serial device, which is podex
attched to, what can be in Linux eg. ttyS? for ordinary COM-port or
ttyUSB? in case of USB converter. Attention, in current version of
BDM12 port under unix there is contatenated prefix "/dev/" to the name
of device -- this saves your fingers of typing of 5 characters, but it
is restrictive and not very clever and it should be as soon as possible
put away from the code. E-clock_rate is a frequency of BDM bus of
target HC12, but in current version it is restricted to 4 integer
values, because it uses only <a href="podex_fw.en.html#p-set-param">SetParam</a>
firmware command (I hope we'll very soon add support for arbitrary rated HC12's using
<a href="podex_fw.en.html#p-extended-speed">ExtendedSpeed</a> firmware command).
</p>
<p>Argument register_base tells podex, that registers will be moved
somewhere, see <a href="podex_fw.en.html#p-set-register-base">SetRegisterBase</a>
firmware command. Arguments ram_base, eeprom_base and flash_base gives information about
location of internal memories, ie. 2KB RAM, 32KB FLASH and 768B
EEPROM. It is not clear to me, how to solve complicated cases of
numerous different configurations of external memories of different
types (RAM, FLASH) connected to HC12 -- maybe it would be fine to look
to more mature ports of gdb code for other processors for inspiration
(if they exist and solve it).
</p>
<p>If we want to debug a code from binary file, which contains
debugging information (function and variable names -- labels, numbers
of lines in source), we can supply its name as an argument when
starting gdb or later by a file command.
</p>
<p>Program code is loaded to HC12 CPU by a load command (large data
segments can probably by a restore command, but I haven't used it).
This is a most important and also a most complicated task for gdb with
podex. Program (data) can be loaded either in RAM, but also to EEPROM
and mainly to FLASH, which is programmed by gdb via podex according to
a proedure, described later. This way, gdb can be used as an internal
HC12 FLASH memory programmer. Properties and problems of FLASH memory
programming are described in next section.
</p>
<p>After program is placed in some of HC12's memories, in the simplest
case in RAM, it can be runned, stepped, stopped and tortured in any
manner. Breakpoints can be set by a break command, on a line number
level (break 33 or break apollo_jets.c:1811), function name (break
speed_up) or memory address (break *0x8a0d). Program is started by a
run command, then it can be interrupted by pressing Ctrl-C. Execution
can be then resumed by continue command, stepped by commands step
(including diving to inner functions), next (to the next source line),
until etc. on the source level, and on the machine instruction level by
stepi, nexti (nexti similarly doesn't dive to subroutine calls).
</p>
<p>Gdb also allows to mess with HC12 registers and memory, contents of
all (and there is really a lot of them at HC12) registers can be dumped
with a regs command, writing to them is done by a set command (set
$d=-1977, set $pc=0x8000), which can also write to a memory, as well as
to a variable (set rpm=0) or arbitrary address (set *0x804=0xbeef).
Maybe, there could probably work also writing to a FLASH, but I'm not
sure, if current BDM12 port won't damage RAM contents. To read single
registers, variables or memory, there can be used a print command
(print $x, print gear_box-&gt;wheel[5], print *0x806).
To read from certain memory addresses, there is a useful command x (examine),
which can show value in many different number bases and of arbitrary bit size
(x/b *0x808 will show byte from the address, x/h *0x808 will show 16bit word
from that address).
If you will get a suspicion or paranoia, which can easily happen while
debugging, you can dump the instructions within a function or a memory
region by disassemble command (disassemble _start, disassemble
slow_down, disassemble 0x802c 0x8100, without argument will disassemble
the function, in which currently executed code of HC12 is).</p>
<p>GNU gdb is a mighty beast, so for discovering possibilities of its
use with podex or without it, consult gdb command help | trying out |
documentation | sources reading. Have a fun!
</p>
<p>GNU gdb BDM12 (ie. podex) support code by Tim Housel is placed
mainly in bdm12.c file, constant definitions and declarations are in
bdm12.h file, this is glued with main program of gdb by remote-bdm12.c
file. For FLASH programming purposes, there are files
bdm12_eraseflash.h and bdm12_programflash.h.</p>

<a name="4-1-3"></a><h3>FLASH memory programming</h3>

<p>HC12 internal FLASH memories are accessed for reading in an ordinary
manner, the same as RAM and EEPROM is read, either by any machine code
instruction or using BDM commands READ_BYTE, READ_WORD. But for writing
to internal FLASH it is needed to traffic a bit with HC12 control
registers and to satisfy timing, as well as with EEPROM. But, in
opposite, FLASH cannot be programmed directly by BDM write commands (to
control registers and memory). To write to internal FLASH memories of
HC12, there must be a program (routine) loaded to HC12 RAM, which will
do FLASH writing operation.
</p>
<p>There is a problem, that programmer's models of internal memories of
different HC12 types is also different and probably there cannot be one
universal routine, which could write to FLASH memories of all of HC12
variants. One man from Motorola assured me, that in HCS12 series they
have advanced and there will be applied the same programmer's model for
all FLASH memories in HCS12. Well, it seems that evolution goes
sometimes not only backward, as from hand-axe to cellular phone. On the
other hand, there will always remain wide set of different development
boards with external FLASH memories, so if we would like to program
them via BDM also, we will need appropriate routine for each of them.
</p>
<p>HC12 FLASH programming is done in following steps: first, there is
loaded an erasing program to RAM, and by its execution, entire FLASH is
erased. Then, there is loaded a writing program to RAM, and into the
free rest of RAM, there is always put a block of data, which is then,
after passing information about target block position in FLASH and
block length, programmed into the FLASH. Execution of writing program
is repeated for each next block, until entire data are programmed into
FLASH. Loading of erasing and writing routines to RAM, their execution
and passing of parameters (by register or memory location) is done via
BDM, after finishing execution of routines, they use to issue a BGND
instruction, what is also detected by BDM. There is also necessary to
tell to programs about timing, because it is derived from HC12 clock.
</p>

<a name="gdb-flash"></a><h3>FLASH and gdb</h3>

<p>Current support of HC12 FLASHing in gdb is in a dismal state. Tim
Housel filled bdm12_eraseflash.h and bdm12_programflash.h files by
routines for programming M68HC12B32 family FLASH, moreover, containing
fixed timing constant, see their sourcecode. So, probably, this
source is able to successfuly program only FLASH memories of HC12B32
with 16MHz crystal frequency.</p>
<p>How to overcome? The best solution would be to have</p>
<ul>
<li>unified program interface for execution of erasing and writing
routines, ie. defined calling, perhaps relocation, parameter passing --
containing target and maybe also source address, data block length and
CPU frequency</li>
<li>set (a lots of) erasing and writing routines dynamically loadable
from a file, external to gdb, allowing the user to supply own routines
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Such solution is implemented for example by
<a href="http://www.pemicro.com/support/flash_list_menu.cfm">P&amp;E for HC12</a>,
<a href="index.en.html#pavel-pisa">Pavel Pí¹a for M683xx</a>.
There is a question, which
format to choose for external loadable routines, maybe it would be fine
to use ELF, which already solves symbol names and relocation -- but on
the other hand, it is a complex beast and from other point of view, the
simplicity of headerless binary file is really beautiful...
Furthermore, it would be also desirable to look to some other parts of
gdb, if there is dynamical loading of some kind of modules already
solved in gdb, for efforts to be unified. I would like to live to see
such flexible and efficient support of HC12 FLASHing in gdb and I would
also like, if I will have a time, to help with it a bit, but now I'm
heavily occupied, so I hope somebody else will join the task.
</p>
<p>As a temporary solution, there could be defined a simple
head(er)less interface, similar to code of Tim Housel, where would be
defined memory offsets of necessary argument and maybe there could be
also supplied some skeleton of program in assembler or GNU C (with
delay loop in assembler), to help users to supply their particular
routines for their specific HC12 confgurations, and also to extend
current code of passing of a HC12 CPU frequency (timing) argument.
</p>
<p>What to do, if you need with current state of gdb port to use a
FLASH with your flavour of HC12? I have been in the same case, when I
had to prepare for my colleague support for internal FLASH of
M68HC12D60A, at least its upper 32KB bank. With the minimal effort, or
in other words, with minimum intervention to gdb code and within
minimal time, I have only replaced support code for HC12B32 in
bdm12_*flash.h by the code for HC12D60A.
</p>
<p>For the educational and inquisitive reasons, I haven't wrote the
code by myself, but rather used freely downloadable routines from
<a href="http://www.pemicro.com/support/flash_list_menu.cfm">P&amp;E
server</a>. The main goal of this was to speculate, whether it
would be good in the future (hope it will come) support of dynamically
loadable modules to use the same or similar philosophy, as our
predecessors did.

If it will be allowed by your conscience and by the law of your country,
you will see, that these are in fact S-records, enriched by a
header with some initial setup of some registers; this header can be
deleted and then cruelly disassembled by <tt>m68hc12-objdump -mm68hc12 -D
something.sx</tt>. If you need it quickly and only for personal use,
I hope, that nobody will be angry at you about that.</p>

<a name="4-1-5"></a><h3>Incorporating of own programming routine to the current (poor) code
of gdb</h3>

<p>I will describe a recipe, by which I added a support (as a temporary
solution, but you know, that temporary solutions are immortal) for
erasing and writing to 32KB FLASH of HC12D60A. Patch for programming of
32KB FLASH of D60A is <a href="sw/flash/gdb-blesk_d60.diff">here</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>create own flashing program, probably in assembler, but it should
make sense to do it in C also (I'd like to put here some example);
programming algorithm (what to write to which control registers and how
many microseconds to sleep between) is described in datasheet of
particular HC12 (eg. for D60A it is <a href="doc/MC68HC912D60A.pdf">here</a>
on page 102), or sometimes in an application note
(for D60A it is <a href="doc/M68HC12_AN2166.pdf">this</a>)</li>
<li>to look, how
should the result appear, you can look
<a href="sw/flash/blesk_d60/blesk.s">here</a>; remark: I was too
lazy to divide the code to erasing and flashing part, so I left it in
one block, even it's true, that erase part occupies a space in RAM</li>
<li>to compile the program -- I don't know why, but I haven't
succeeded with generation of binary incarnation of a code, located in
RAM from address 0x800, with GNU assembler gas and binutils -- after
conversion by objcopy it filled address fields with nonsense zeroes
(you must excuse my inability to work with GNU tools); solution, even
it is a pity:
  <ul>
<li>I used assembler ASM12 by <a href="http://www.mgtek.com/">MGTEK</a>,
    freely downloadable as a
    Linux or HP-UX binary <a href="http://www.mgtek.com/miniide/download/unix.aspx">here</a>
</li>
<li>unfortunately, this assembler expects different syntax, than
    gas, so I wrote one cosmically fool conversion program in perl
    <a href="sw/flash/blesk_d60/gas2mgtek.pl">gas2mgtek.pl</a>
    </li>
</ul>
  </li>
<li>to make a constant (global variable) in a header file
<tt>bdm*flash.h</tt> from the compiled program, I did it using
<a href="sw/flash/blesk_d60/mpconvert.c">mpconvert.c</a>
(see original <tt>convert.c</tt> in Tim Housel's comment) and this
<a href="sw/flash/blesk_d60/Makefile">Makefile</a>;
resulting header file is then, in my lazy case,
<a href="sw/flash/blesk_d60/bdm12_programflash.h">included</a>
to both bdm12_program and eraseflash.h</li>
</ul>
<p>Demonstration files can be downloaded
<a href="sw/flash/blesk_d60/">here</a>
(packed in .tar.gz <a href="sw/flash/blesk_d60.tar.gz">here</a>).
